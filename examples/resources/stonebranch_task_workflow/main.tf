# Stonebranch Workflow Task Example
#
# This example demonstrates how to create workflow task resources in Stonebranch.
# Workflow tasks orchestrate the execution of multiple tasks in sequence.
#
# Note: Tasks within the workflow (vertices) and their dependencies (edges) are
# typically managed through the StoneBranch UI after the workflow is created.
#
# Usage:
#   export STONEBRANCH_API_TOKEN="your-token"
#   terraform init
#   terraform plan
#   terraform apply

terraform {
  required_providers {
    stonebranch = {
      source = "stonebranch/stonebranch"
    }
  }
}

provider "stonebranch" {
  # Uses STONEBRANCH_API_TOKEN environment variable
}
